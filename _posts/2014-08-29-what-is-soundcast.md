Did you love playing city building games when you were growing up? Or do you still play phone games where you build cities or farms? I do. I like to optimize resource allocation and watch organic patterns of city growth. I like to build roads and balance zoning types. Activity-based travel modelers get to build and run software that is like SimCity!

With our activity-based model called SoundCast, we model synthetic people (like Sims) as they move throughout their day. We model where these synthetic people go to work and school, where they shop and eat, and when they do these activities. SoundCast predicts whether people will take transit, drive, walk, or bike.  Then it predicts which roads and transit routes they will use.

By adding up all these person units of travel behavior, we end up with volumes on roads and people on buses.  This will tell us if the transportation network is performing well.

###What can we use these results for?

*SoundCast can be used to:*   
                                             
*	Analyze how  transit, walking, and biking rates will be impacted by future changes in the transportation network and land use

*	Compare regional growth centers in terms of forecasted  VMT and mode shares of people living and working there

*	Forecast transit line use and volumes on a roads in one hour time periods in the peak hours

*	Clarify how packages of transportation projects and future tolling could impact a variety of households in different ways throughout the region

*But SoundCast can also be used to:*

*	Find good locations for electric car charging and bicycle share stations

*	Forecast walk and bicycle facility use 

*	Describe how the aging population will impact our transportation networks

*	Explore how alternative land use scenarios cause people to travel differently

*	Elucidate how increasing congestion in the future will suppress travel to some degree, and also how people will change the time of their trips to avoid congestion


The table below shows the list of models in SoundCast.

| Model Name  |What is Predicted|
|---|---|---|
|Usual Work Location|Location of Work Parcel| 
|Usual School Location|Location of School Parcel |
|Paid Parking at Work|Whether or not a person pays to park at work|
|Transit Pass Ownership|Whether or not a person owns a transit pass|
|Auto Availability|The number of autos a household owns|
|Person Day Pattern|The types of activities a person will perform in a day|
|Exact Number of Tours|How many tours a person will take for each purpose   |
|Tour Destination Models| Where people go to make tours| 
|Tour Mode Choice Models| What mode people take to reach their destinations   |
|Tour Time of Day Models| When people arrive and depart their destinations|
|Intermediate Stop Generation| How many stops to make on each tour|
|Intermediate Stop Location| Where stops are located|
|Trip Mode Choice | Which mode to take on trips|
