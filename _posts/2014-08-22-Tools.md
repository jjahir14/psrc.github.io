Managing the enormous datasets and software systems at PSRC is... challenging. We're always on the lookout for tools and 
utilities that will make our jobs easier or more efficient! 
Today I want to talk about a few of those tools and why we love them.  

### Git and GitHub

_Software revision control and bug tracking_


### Slack

_Group communications_


### Jenkins

_Centralized testing framework_


### Pandas

_Data analysis - quickly!_
