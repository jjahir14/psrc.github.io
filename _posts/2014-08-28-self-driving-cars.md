Automated vehicles (AVs) may be seen on the roads of our region in the next ten years. Meanwhile, local governments are making long range transportation plans with time horizons out to year 2040 and beyond. PSRC staff used its new regional activity-based travel model to test the potential effects of AVs on the local transportation network and individual travel choices. This was a ground-breaking effort, as little predictive work has been done on this topic. PSRC staff submitted the methodology and modeling results for consideration at the Transportation Research Boardâ€™s annual meeting in January 2015.

The results are highly speculative, since no one really knows what the technology or business model surrounding these vehicles will look like yet. Instead of trying to predict actual impacts, we came up with several scenarios of possible outcomes, and tried to model them and review the results.

...more to come...
