Automated vehicles (AVs) may be seen on the roads of our region in the next ten years. 
Meanwhile, local governments are making long range transportation plans with time horizons 
out to year 2040 and beyond. PSRC staff used the existing regional activity-based travel model 
to test the potential effects of AVs on the local transportation network and individual travel choices. 
This was a ground-breaking effort as little predictive work has been done on this topic. 
The results should help local governments anticipate and plan for future transportation needs. 
PSRC staff published the modeling results and their conclusions in a paper to be presented at the 
Transportation Research Board’s annual meeting in January 2015.

Preliminary results predict improvements in roadway carrying capacity
because the AV’s vehicle-to-vehicle coordination systems allow cars to travel 
close together at high speeds. This should lead to an improved travel experience, 
because trips would be shorter and there would be drastic reductions in traffic jams due 
to overcrowded roads or accidents. These improvements could lead to a large increase in vehicle-miles 
traveled (VMT), as drivers opt to travel more. 
This in turn would lead to increased green-house gas emissions, which is counter to PSRC’s goals. 
There are many other aspects of this new technology that could affect individual behavior, 
including cost and availability of AVs, potential vmt-based taxes and pay-as-you-drive insurance policies, 
and among others.
