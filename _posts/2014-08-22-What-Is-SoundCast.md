SoundCast is a computer simulation tool that predicts the travel choices of people in the Puget Sound Region. PSRC uses this model to compare the possible outcomes of future growth and investment scenarios.

SoundCast predicts the choices of people in the region, including:

* Where to work and go to school
* How many cars to own
* How many trips to make in the day for different reasons like shopping, working, or eating a meal
* Whether to drive, walk, bike, or use transit on a trip?
* When to make a trip
* Which roads and transit routes to use

### What questions could we explore?

* What if we put in a new light rail line?
* What if we decide to implement congestion pricing?
* What if the 15% of workers worked from home?
* How does higher density land use impact walking and biking?
* What are realistic transit mode share goals?
