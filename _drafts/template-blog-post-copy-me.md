This is a sample blog post template.  Be sure to edit the "front matter" fields at the top, to the correct title, author, link, and header image.

Then blog away using Markdown syntax!  Don't forget you can use raw HTML
in a Markdown document, if Markdown doesn't do everything you need it to.

## My favorite Markdown tags:

```markdown

[myimage]: /images/myimage.png "My image caption"
* creates a shortcut to myimage so I can reference it easily in my document

```

myimage:

['alt text'][myimage]

Happy blogging!
