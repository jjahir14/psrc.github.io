Many companies that collect geographic data are beginning to share the information via application programming interfaces, known as "API's".
These API's allow free (usually) access to the data by developing little snippets of code. Some examples we use at PSRC are: 


|  Company | website  |  data item | how to use  |
|---|---|---|---|
|Google | |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |
